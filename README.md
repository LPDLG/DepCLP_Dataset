## Abstract
This paper addresses the challenging task of novel view synthesis for traditional Chinese landscape paintings, which typically offer only a single perspective and lack clear depth information. To overcome the limitations of existing methods that rely on multi-view input and depth estimation, we propose a multi-view synthesis method for Chinese landscape paintings, termed MVSM-CLP. The proposed CLPDepth Module employs a high-low resolution fusion mechanism to enhance detail expression while preserving the original scene structure. We introduce an image restoration technique guided by landscape ink lines, termed LInpainting, to improve edge extraction and the accuracy of painting restoration. Additionally, our method tackles the issue of scarce 3D data in current view synthesis efforts by constructing multi-view data from a single ancient painting. Our approach effectively bridges the gap between 2D art and 3D visualization, creating vivid and realistic virtual environments while preserving the traditional style and essence of Chinese paintings. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving high-quality multi-view synthesis, offering new possibilities for the digital preservation of cultural heritage.
